					<p><a class ="link link--on-light-bg link--inline" target="_blank" href="https://www.seek.com.au/">SEEK</a> is the largest online employment marketplace in Australia.</p>
					<p>With most of SEEK’s revenue coming from job ad placements, it was critical to improve the existing online payment form.</p>
			</div>

		<div class="section section--light ">
			<div class="sub-section__content sub-section--first-in-section">
					<h2 class="h2-heading">The challenge</h2>

					<p>When I started working on the project, less than 20% of people posting their job ads paid for them using our credit card form at the time of ad posting. Instead, they opted to pay upon receipt of an invoice.</p>
					<p>This had a major impact on cash flow, as well as cost associated with debt collection and unpaid invoices.</p>
					<p>My challenge was to design a new payment form and increase the number of people paying by card.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="sub-section__content">
					<h2 class="h2-heading">Current state</h2>

					<p>The existing online payment form was archaic to say the least. When you ask people to hand over their financial details online, you have to instil confidence. A form that looks like this falls short in the task of instilling confidence </p>

					<img class="image--medium image--with-caption" src="/images/seek_existing_credit_card_form.png">
					<div class="image-caption">The existing card form left a lot of space for improvement</div>

					<h3 class="h3-heading">Issues with the existing form</h3>
					<ul class="list">
						<li class="list__item">Wrong visual hierarchy: eyes are too strongly drawn to the accepted cards.</li>
						<li class="list__item">Invoice details too hard to read.</li>
						<li class="list__item">The ‘back’ and ‘proceed’ buttons are not clearly differentiated.</li>
						<li class="list__item">Using all caps on the buttons makes it harder to quickly distinguish the words.</li>
						<li class="list__item">The input fields are cramped and very ‘web 1.0’</li>
						<li class="list__item">The user has to manually select card type.</li>
						<li class="list__item">Card expiry uses drop-downs.</li>
					</ul>
					
			</div>
			<div class="sub-section__content">
					<h2 class="h2-heading">Don't reinvent the wheel</h2>

					<p>Credit card forms are nothing new. I didn’t see it as my job to create something completely new, but rather to take stock of existing best practice designs and put together a design that suited our user base and the flow the card payment would be used within.</p> 

					<h3 class="h3-heading">Do your research</h3>

					<p>I looked at the ways different sites handled input masking, card type selection, saving of card details and help for the security code.</p>
					<p>I collected a <a class ="link link--on-light-bg link--inline" target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/p4jll0acqhczc3d/AABsRBC8H9wK0r0lJ7tsJy5ya?dl=0">folder</a> of examples I liked, and used some of these as inspiration for my designs.</p>

					<h3 class="h3-heading">Know your audience</h3>

					<p>There were two innovative card form designs that I really liked, but chose not to use as they don’t fit with our design philosophy or our audience.</p>

					<p>The first is the <a class ="link link--on-light-bg link--inline" target="_blank" href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/single-field-credit-card-input-pattern/">single field card form</a>, popularised by Brad Frost.</p>

					<img class="image--medium image--with-caption" src="/images/seek_credit_card_single-cc-demo.gif">
					<div class="image-caption">Cool and innovative, but not fit for our audience</div>

					<p>This is a brilliantly elegant solution, particulary for mobile phones where space is at a premium. I chose not to use it for two reasons. Firstly, our form was being built exclusively for desktop. More importantly, SEEK caters to an extremely diverse audience of users with varying levels of computer literacy – providing credit card details this way would not be familiar to most of our audience.</p>  

					<p>The second pattern was the skeuomorphic form that reflected the appearance of a card. One example is the <a class ="link link--on-light-bg link--inline" target="_blank" href="http://kenkeiter.com/skeuocard/">Skeuocard</a> by Ken Keiter.</p>

					<p>This is another neat and innovative pattern. What I particularly liked about is that we could do away with instructions for retrieving the card security code, since we could show it on the card itself.</p> 

					<img class="image--medium" src="/images/seek_skeuocard_visa.png">

					<p>However, this wasn't enough of a reason to depart from a tried and tested way of collecting card information. In addition, the style we have been evolving at SEEK leans away from skeumorphism in favour of near flat design.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="sub-section__content">
					<h2 class="h2-heading">Do we go responsive?</h2>

					<p>The answer was ‘no’. Not for now anyway. Our current job ad posting workflow is desktop only. Since the card payment is part of that workflow, it made no sense to build a responsive payment form at this stage.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="sub-section__content">
					<h2 class="h2-heading">Refining each form detail</h2>

					<h3 class="h3-heading">Payment options</h3>
					<p>The first step in nudging more people to pay by card, was to make the ‘Pay via credit card’ option more prominent.</p>
					<p>The current design had the two options presented with equal visual weight.</p>

					<img class="image--medium image--with-caption" src="/images/seek_card_presentation_of_options.png">
					<div class="image-caption">Payment options with equal weight on the right</div>

					<p>While leaving both options available, I changed this to make the card option much more prominent than the invoice option.</p>

					<img class="image--medium image--with-caption" src="/images/seek_card_presentation_of_options2.png">
					<div class="image-caption">Preferred payment option clearly santds out – bottom left</div>

					<h3 class="h3-heading">Input masking</h3>
					<p>Transcribing long numbers into an online form is hard, because it is easy to lose track of where you are up to. For this reason, input masking that reflects the grouping of card numbers on the card itself makes number entry much easier.</p>
					<p>We made sure we reflected the different number patterns, depending on the card type.</p>

					<p>For American express...</p>

					<img class="image--small" src="/images/seek_card_number_input_masking_amex.png">

					<p>And for all the other cards...</p>

					<img class="image--small" src="/images/seek_card_number_input_masking_other.png">

					<h3 class="h3-heading">Capturing the expiry date</h3>
					<p>There are many ways to capture the expiry date. I considered the following options.</p>

					<img class="image--medium" src="/images/seek_card_expiry_date_collection.png">

					<p>I ruled out alt F straight away because drop-downs are the most ‘expensive’ in terms of interaction cost.</p>
					<p>Alt B and D appealed because they reflected the way the expiry date is presented on the card itself, most often inlcuding the ‘/’ character. However, I did not like using two fields to capture what is esentialy a single piece of information.</p>
					<p>This left me with alt A, C and E. I felt that some guidance regarding what was expected in the field was needed, so I rulled out A. </p>
					<p>I am generally against using placeholders in fields, and we don’t do it at SEEK. However, alt C most closely reflected the way expiry date is shown on the card itself. We were also able to automatically ‘type’ the ‘/’ character for the user, once they entered the month. This made it very easy to enter the date, as we validated in our usability testing (see below).</p>

					<h3 class="h3-heading">Storing users’ card details</h3>
					<p>There is a big benefit in storing users’ card details. It makes subsequent checkouts quicker, ultimately improving the checkout rate.</p>
					<p>Many people are weary of storing their card details online, so we carefully crafted the micro-copy around this option.</p>
					
					<img class="image--medium" src="/images/seek_card_store_details.png">

					<p>Let’s break down this copy.</p>
					<ul class="list">
						<li class="list__item">‘Securely’ reasures the user that this is a secure payment form.</li>
						<li class="list__item">‘check out faster next time' sells the benefit of saving card details.</li>
						<li class="list__item">‘Not shared with other users’, puts the user at ease, knowing that other users on this account will not be able to see their card details.</li>
					</ul>

			</div>

			<div class="sub-section__content">
					<h2 class="h2-heading">Usability testing</h2>

					<p>We tested the credit card form as part of the job ad posting process. We waited for each participant to express whether they would pay for the ad by card or invoice. If they opted for card, they were given a dummy credit card so they could enter the details.</p>
					<p>The key things I was interested in seeing first hand were:</p>
					<ul class="list">
						<li class="list__item">Is card type detection useful or distracting?</li>
						<li class="list__item">Is the input masking for the date field intuitive?</li>
						<li class="list__item">How do people feel about saving their card details?</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3 class="h3-heading">Usability testing findings</h3>

					<p>We found that none of participants attempted clicking on the card logos, meaning they were not misunderstood for interactive elements. A couple of participants commented on how useful it was to get the confirmation that your card type was recognised, once they started typing the card number.</p>
					<p>The input masking for the expiry date worked without a hitch. Typing was evidently a natural way for people to enter dates.</p>
					<p>Half of the participants expressed hesitation with saving their card information in general, not just on our site. However, they commented that our explanation made it clear why we gave that option and that it put them more at ease about doing so.	</p>

					<h2 class="h2-heading">The final design</h2>
					<img class="image--medium" src="/images/browser_with_card_form.png">
			</div>
			
			<div class="sub-section__content sub-section--last-in-section">
					<h2 class="h2-heading">The outcome</h2>

					<p>After the first six months of the new form going live, the percentage of payments being completed by credit card (instead of invoice) jumped from 30% to 74%.</p>
					<p>The number of card transactions increased by a factor of six, meaning that we were sending out a lot less invoices.</p>
					<p>Most importantly, our upfront cash flow increased by a six figure sum and the debt collection agency we used reported a reduction in business from SEEK.</p>
