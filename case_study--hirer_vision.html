				<h1 class="h1-heading">Cocreating a product vision</h1>
					<p><a class ="link link--on-light-bg link--inline" target="_blank" href="https://www.seek.com.au/">SEEK</a> is the largest online employment marketplace in Australia.</p>
					<p>With size comes complexity, and SEEK's numerous product teams were finding it difficult to visualise how their individual efforts would come together to create a superior experience for our users.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section section--light ">
			<div class="sub-section__content sub-section--first-in-section">
					<h2 class="h2-heading">The challenge</h2>

					<p>At any one time, SEEK has dozens of projects running in parallel, either building new products or improving existing ones.</p>
					<p>In this cycle of continuous improvement and tactical product development, it is easy to lose track of the bigger picture. It becomes hard to see how all the products will fit together and where the company is going to be in two, three or five years time.</p>

					<h3 class="h3-heading">Mockups – the obvious choice</h3>
					<p>Whenever we started discussions on how to articulate our product vision, inevitably someone would say 'why don't we just mock up what it could look like?'.</p>
					<p>I've attempted this approach before and know that there are many problems with it – I will name just three of the biggest ones:</p>
					<ul class="list">
						<li class="list__item">mockups are time consuming to produce</li>
						<li class="list__item">mockups elicit the wrong tipe of feedback</li>
						<li class="list__item">producing mockups isolates the designer and perpetuates the 'ivory tower' view of design</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 class="h3-heading">So what's the alternative?</h3>
					<p>Before settling on how to articulate the vision, I decided to find out what the team understood the purpose of a product vision to be, and what they wanted to get out of it. I surveyed around 30 people from the teams whose products would be affected.</p>

					<h3 class="h3-heading">Defining the deliverables</h3>
					<p>The resulting definition of the vision purpose guided the proposal for how to articulate the vision.</p>
					<ul class="list">
						<li class="list__item"><strong>journey maps</strong> to show the big picture and how proudcts fit together</li>
						<li class="list__item"><strong>wireframes</strong> to zoom in on the detail, only where required</li>
						<li class="list__item"><strong>videos</strong> to illustrate the experience future products may enable</li>
						<li class="list__item"><strong>research</strong> to validate our journey maps and wireframes</li>
					</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="sub-section__content">
					<h2 class="h2-heading">The process | <nobr>journey mapping</nobr></h2>
					<p>Coming up with the above deliverables <strong>as a team</strong> was by far the most important artefact of the whole process. Over the course of three monhts, I engaged the entire Advertiser stream at SEEK (around 100 people), including designers, developers, testers and everyone else involved in delivering the products.</p>

					<h3 class="h3-heading">Step 1. review existing research</h3>
					<p>The first step was to review all the relevant user research performed over the last three years, and identify pain points and opportunities we could use as a starting point for journey mapping.</p>

					<h3 class="h3-heading">Step 2. user journey mapping workshops</h3>
					<p>Prior to the workshops, I defined the format of the journey map we wanted to walk away with.</p>
					<div id="mapdesign-img-container" class="image--medium image--with-caption placeholder" data-large="resources/images/vision_map_design.jpg">
						<img id="mapdesign-img-placeholder" class="img-small" src="resources/images/vision_map_design_PLACEHOLDER.jpg">
						<div style="padding-bottom: 70.7%;"></div>
					</div>
					<script type="text/javascript">lazyLoadImage('mapdesign-img-container','mapdesign-img-placeholder',"The proposed journey map format");</script>
					<div class="image-caption">The proposed journey map format</div>

					<p>The workshops were tightly timed, as I had to run nine of them, with around ten people in each.</p>
					<div id="creating-img-container" class="image--medium image--with-caption placeholder" data-large="resources/images/vision_creating_journey_map_2.jpg">
						<img id="creating-img-placeholder" class="img-small" src="resources/images/vision_creating_journey_map_2_PLACEHOLDER.jpg">
						<div style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div>
					</div>
					<script type="text/javascript">lazyLoadImage('creating-img-container','creating-img-placeholder',"Creating the journey map together");</script>
					<div class="image-caption">Creating the journey map together</div>

					<p>At the end of each workshop, we had a large amount of information that had to be synthesised into something that could be shared with the wider team.</p>
					<div id="output-img-container" class="image--medium image--with-caption placeholder" data-large="resources/images/vision_creating_journey_map.jpg">
						<img id="output-img-placeholder" class="img-small" src="resources/images/vision_creating_journey_map_PLACEHOLDER.jpg">
						<div style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div>
					</div>
					<script type="text/javascript">lazyLoadImage('output-img-container','output-img-placeholder',"Journey map workshop output");</script>
					<div class="image-caption">Journey map workshop output</div>

					<h3 class="h3-heading">Step 3. creating detailed journey maps</h3>
					<p>Based on the output of the workshops, I created three detailed journey maps, each covering a different user segment.</p>
					<p>The format I came up with covered pain points, opportunities, products and aspirational touch points.</p>
					<div id="map-img-container" class="image--medium image--with-caption placeholder" data-large="resources/images/vision_journey_map.png">
						<img id="map-img-placeholder" class="img-small" src="resources/images/vision_journey_map_PLACEHOLDER.png">
						<div style="padding-bottom: 50%;"></div>
					</div>
					<script type="text/javascript">lazyLoadImage('map-img-container','map-img-placeholder',"Detailed journey map");</script>
					<div class="image-caption">Detailed journey map (deliberately blurry due to commercially sensitve nature of the content)</div>

					<p>Each touch-point described how the user would interact with SEEK and contained a progress bar indicating how well we belived we understood the problem space as well as a reference to a wireframe, if relevant.</p>
					<div id="sample-img-container" class="image--medium image--with-caption placeholder" data-large="resources/images/vision_journey_map_sample.png">
						<img id="sample-img-placeholder" class="img-small" src="resources/images/vision_journey_map_sample_PLACEHOLDER.png">
						<div style="padding-bottom: 73.73%;"></div>
					</div>
					<script type="text/javascript">lazyLoadImage('sample-img-container','sample-img-placeholder',"Journey map touch point");</script>
					<div class="image-caption">Journey map touch point</div>

					<h3 class="h3-heading">Step 4. creating wireframes</h3>
					<p>During the workshops, we identified touchpoints where we belived it would be valuable to see more detail. For these touchpoints, I came up with high level wireframes to illustrate how they might play out.</p>
					<p>It was important to keep these at a high enough level to reflect the uncertainty we had around them, while providing enough detail for them to be useful.</p>
					<div id="mockups-img-container" class="image--medium image--with-caption placeholder" data-large="resources/images/vision_mockups.png">
						<img id="mockups-img-placeholder" class="img-small" src="resources/images/vision_mockups_PLACEHOLDER.png">
						<div style="padding-bottom: 45.41%;"></div>
					</div>
					<script type="text/javascript">lazyLoadImage('mockups-img-container','mockups-img-placeholder',"Wireframes to support touch points on the journey map");</script>
					<div class="image-caption">Wireframes to support touch points on the journey map</div>

					<h3 class="h3-heading">Step 5. review journey maps and wireframes</h3>
					<p>I had a lot of stakeholders to review the journey maps with, so I organised another round of workshops to do that. Once I collected and analysed all the feedback, it was a matter of updating the journey maps and wireframes and sharing the final output with the teams.</p>
					<div id="review-img-container" class="image--medium image--with-caption placeholder" data-large="resources/images/vision_reviewing_journey_map.jpg">
						<img id="review-img-placeholder" class="img-small" src="resources/images/vision_reviewing_journey_map_PLACEHOLDER.jpg">
						<div style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div>
					</div>
					<script type="text/javascript">lazyLoadImage('review-img-container','review-img-placeholder',"Collecting feedback on draft journey maps");</script>
					<div class="image-caption">Collecting feedback on draft journey maps</div>

			</div>

			<div class="sub-section__content">
					<h2 class="h2-heading">The process | <nobr>vision video</nobr></h2>
					<p>The journey maps and wireframes were great at communicating detail of what we wanted to achive, but they required some time and effort to consume. To make it easier to share the vision with broader SEEK teams, we decided to experiment with creating a video that communicates what it's going to be like to use SEEK in two to three years time.</p>

					<h3 class="h3-heading">Step 1. mapping out the narrative</h3>
					<p>First, we mapped out a story we wanted to create the video for.</p>
					<div id="storyline-img-container" class="image--medium image--with-caption placeholder" data-large="resources/images/vision_starting_out.jpg">
						<img id="storyline-img-placeholder" class="img-small" src="resources/images/vision_starting_out_PLACEHOLDER.jpg">
						<div style="padding-bottom: 39.36%;"></div>
					</div>
					<script type="text/javascript">lazyLoadImage('storyline-img-container','storyline-img-placeholder',"Mapping out the video storyline");</script>
					<div class="image-caption">Mapping out the video storyline</div>

					<h3 class="h3-heading">Step 2. draw storyboard images</h3>
					<p>I'm lucky to work with a designer who is amazing at creating illustrations – he created an illustration for each scene, which we then touched up in Photoshop.</p>
					<div id="scott-img-container" class="image--medium image--with-caption placeholder" data-large="resources/images/vision_creating_story_boards.jpg">
						<img id="scott-img-placeholder" class="img-small" src="resources/images/vision_creating_story_boards_PLACEHOLDER.jpg">
						<div style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div>
					</div>
					<script type="text/javascript">lazyLoadImage('scott-img-container','scott-img-placeholder',"My colleague Scott working on storyboard images");</script>
					<div class="image-caption">My colleague Scott working on storyboard images</div>

					<div id="storyboards-img-container" class="image--medium image--with-caption placeholder" data-large="resources/images/vision_story_boards.jpg">
						<img id="storyboards-img-placeholder" class="img-small" src="resources/images/vision_story_boards_PLACEHOLDER.jpg">
						<div style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div>
					</div>
					<script type="text/javascript">lazyLoadImage('storyboards-img-container','storyboards-img-placeholder',"Some of the scenes from the video");</script>
					<div class="image-caption">Some of the scenes</div>

					<h3 class="h3-heading">Step 3. produce video</h3>
					<p>I imported the storyboard images into Adobe Premier Pro, added captions, animation, voicover and music and produced the final video.</p>
					<p>You can see a short part of the video below to get a sense of what I produced. I am not able to share the entire video publicly due to the commercially sensitive nature of the content.</p>
					<iframe class="image--medium" width="630" height="354" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kt5ziX3-NbA?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			</div>

			<div class="sub-section__content">
					<h2 class="h2-heading">The process | <nobr>validation research</nobr></h2>
					<p>The final step in articulating the product vision was to validate the concepts we came up with, with real users. To do so, I conducted several contextual user interviews. As a result, we identified parts of the product vision where we needed to do more research into actual user needs, before building those products.</p>
			</div>


			<div class="sub-section__content sub-section--last-in-section">
					<h2 class="h2-heading">The outcome</h2>

					<p>The key achievement was getting the broader team to think about and get actively involved in the process of shaping what the future of SEEK products looks like. That was a resounding success!</p>
					<p>Secondly, this was the first time we could all see the complexity of our product ecosystem in one place, and understand how the different product fit together and how they depend upon each other.</p>

					<h3 class="h3-heading">Vision without execution is halucination</h3>
					<p>In reality, the competitive landscape, the technology and priorities all change. I don't expect us to implement all of the aspects of the product vision we came up with, but I do believe we will execute parts of it (we have already started!). More importantly, we've put mechanisms in place to ensure that the vision artefacts keep getting updated as our circumstances change.</p>
