				<h1 class="h1-heading">About me</h1>

					<h2 class="h2-heading">Technical beginnings</h2>

					<p>After graduating from Engineering (robotics) and Computer Science in 2004, I started my career as a System Design Engineer working on automated cancer diagnostics instruments. I developed a passion for observing how people interact with the machines, systems and software I designed.</p>

					<h2 class="h2-heading">A turning point</h2>

					<p>A career shaping event was an opportunity to spend two years working in the UK and across Europe, studying how medical staff use cancer diagnostic instruments and helping them improve their processes.</p>
					
					<p>That was in 2007. That passion for observing how people interact with products and using those observations to design better experiences, lives on in me and is the key reason why I love what I do.</p>

					<h2 class="h2-heading">My focus today</h2>

					<p>Evolution of my design process and the process of the teams I work with, is something I am very interested in. I am focused on experimenting with, and continuously improving these processes.</p>

					<p>I am a big advocate for use of modern design tools, colaborative design practices and early and continued involvement of users in the design process.</p>

					<p>Sharing knowledge, with people I work with and across the design community, is something I’m passionate about. To this end, I have started a<a class ="link link--on-light-bg link--inline" target="_blank" href=https://www.meetup.com/Sarajevo-UX-Design/> UX design meetup group</a>, presented at<a class ="link link--on-light-bg link--inline" target="_blank" href="http://www.slideshare.net/ThatBaldUXGuy/presentations"> other meetup groups</a> and actively <a class ="link link--on-light-bg link--inline" target="_blank" href="http://medium.com/@ThatBaldUXGuy">write</a> about design.</p>
