					<h2 class="sub-heading">Technical beginnings</h2>

					<p>After graduating from Engineering Design (robotics) and Computer Science in 2004, I started my career as a system design engineer working on automated cancer diagnostics instruments. I developed a passion for observing how people interact with the machines, systems and software I worked on. </p>

					<h2 class="sub-heading">A turning point</h2>

					<p>A career shaping event was an opportunity to spend two years working in the UK and across Europe, studying how medical staff use our instruments and helping them improve their processes.</p>
					
					<p>That was in 2006. That passion for observing how people interact with products and improving their experiences lives on in me and is the key reason why I love what I do.</p>
