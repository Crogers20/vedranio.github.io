				This page is shit!

			<p class="section_paragraph">
				So you're thinking <em>'You are a designer, why does this page look so shit?'</em>. 
				Well, I used to have a shiny, fancy-pants Wordpress theme page, which looked great, but something about it just didn't feel right. Every time I wanted to tweak something, it was too hard. 
			</p>
			<p class="section_paragraph">
				I decided to learn to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript from scratch. What you are seeing here are the very first baby steps I am taking in this journey. 
			</p>
			<p class="section_paragraph">				
				I've written more about this on <a class="dark_link" target="_blank" title="Open Medium in a new tab" href="https://medium.com/@ThatBaldUXGuy/so-im-learning-some-front-end-dev-fb9d5b4f8888">my blog</a>.

				Current work
			</p>

			<p class="section_paragraph">
				Currently, I am working as a senior UX designer at Seek.com.au.
				More specifically, I am working on the advertiser side of the business, building products hirers and recruiters use in sourcing talent.
			</p>
			<p class="section_paragraph">
				Day to day, I work closely with two agile teams and a couple of product managers. My work is a combination of forward looking activities (user research and journey mapping for future products on our roadmap), tactical delivery (designing and testing user flows and interfaces for the projects I am currently working on) as well as contributing to the improvement of processes and the way we design at Seek (e.g. defining a style guide).

				Progress!
			</p>

			<p class="section_paragraph">
				It doesn't look like much, but I've actually made a bit of progress. Here is a list of things I've learnt and implemented so far, since the start of December 2014:
			</p>
			<p class="section_paragraph">
				<ul class="section_paragraph , unordered_list">
					<li>The whole page is now styled using CSS</li>
					<li>I have also learnt how to use Google web fonts (easy)</li>
					<li>The biggest achievement has been setting the whole page to a 30px baseline grid, to achieve vertical rythm. Turns out, this is a bit tricky using CSS</li>
					<li>Figured out the basics of media queries and viewports</li>
					<li>The paragraphs now behave responsively, including padding and min margins around paragraphs</li>
				</ul>
