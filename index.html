			So you're thinking <em>'You are a designer, why does this page look so shit?'</em>. 
			<br><br>
			Well, I used to have a shiny, fancy-pants Wordpress theme page, which looked great, but something about it just didn't feel right. Every time I wanted to tweak something, it was too hard. 
			<br><br>
			I decided to learn to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript from scratch. What you are seeing here are the very first baby steps I am taking in this journey. I could have kept my shiny Wordpress page up while I work on this, but I thought it's better this way - I wanted to get more comforbale showing something that is a work in progress, and hopefully get some feedback in the process.
			<br><br>
			I've written more about this in my blog.

			Currently, I am working as a senior UX designer at Seek.com.au.
			<br><br>
			More specifically, I am working on the advertiser side of the business, building products hirers and recruiters use in sourcing top talent.
			<br><br>
			Day to day, I am working closely with two agile teams and a couple of product managers. My work is a combination of forward looking activities (user research and journey mapping for future products on our roadmap), tactical delivery (designing user flows and interfaces for the projects I am currently working on) as well as contributing to the improvement of processes and the way we design at Seek (e.g. defining a style guide).

			I'm not going to add more to this site for now, as it is getting ineficient.
			<br><br>
			You see, I haven't yet done the lessons on CSS and I am aware that the way I am writing my HTML code is very inefficient (and old-school), so I will take a break until I learn a bit more...
